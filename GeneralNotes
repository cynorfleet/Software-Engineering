From the first meeting:

The test suite will open one or more .cpp and .h files.
The user will choose from multiple levels of test which will check for different levels of exception handling.
It will read the program and look at input variables and suggest input to test the program.
If there are loops then the program will give an appropriate amount of test variables.
The program will also do OOP test and propose test drivers for classes.
The test suite will assume the read program compiles.
Scanning for reprompts may be a future requirement.
The test suite will read C++ but have disabled options for other languages.

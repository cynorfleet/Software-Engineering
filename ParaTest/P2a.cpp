// This program asks the user for the amount of people and prices for a catering
// service. It asks the user for number of adults and children that are coming
// , the prices for adult meals, dessert price, room fee, tax rate, and deposit.
// It then runs several calculations to determine the totals for all meals,
// dessert total, tax total, subtotal, and overall total. Lastly, it prints
// out the results for the user to view.
